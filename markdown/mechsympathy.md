##Mechanical Sympathy Movement

>Jackie Stewart, 3 times Formula 1 world champion, coined the phrase “Mechanical Sympathy” as a term for the driver and the machine working together in harmony. This can be summarised in that a driver does not need to know how to build an engine but they need to know the fundamentals of how one works to get the best out of it.
