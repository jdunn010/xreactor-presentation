##The Reactive Streams Specification

http://www.reactive-streams.org/

>The main goal of Reactive Streams is to govern the exchange of stream data across an asynchronous boundary—think passing elements on to another thread or thread-pool—while ensuring that the receiving side is not forced to buffer arbitrary amounts of data. In other words, back pressure is an integral part of this model in order to allow the queues which mediate between threads to be bounded.
